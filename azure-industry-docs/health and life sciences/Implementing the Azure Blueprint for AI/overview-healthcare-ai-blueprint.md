# Implementing the Azure blueprint for AI

"First, do no harm," is a phrase associated with the medical profession. It's especially true when adopting new technologies. To ensure the privacy of patients, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) was enacted. The question is this: how can a healthcare organization implement a new technology—machine learning—without breaching the rules of HIPAA? The answer lies in the HIPAA blueprint, which is an easy way to install a solution that can give you a head start on machine learning, while safeguarding health data.

The solution guide shows you the value of starting with the blueprint. The installation script provides a machine learning environment where you can experiment with the technology. When you are ready, you can start to mine your own data to gain insights. Because HIPAA standards are built in, you can advance quickly to productivity.

The solution gives you practical advice on installing the solution. It makes sure you are successful in getting started. It also points to the right learning resources for Python and the R language (the best current technologies for ML).
